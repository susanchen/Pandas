def reformat_subway_dates(date):
    '''
    The dates in our subway data are formatted in the format month-day-year.
    The dates in our weather underground data are formatted year-month-date.
    
    In order to join these two data sets together, we'll want the dates formatted
    the same way.  Write a function that takes as its input a date in the MTA Subway
    data format, and returns a date in the weather underground format.
    
    Hint: 
    There is a useful function in the datetime library called strptime. 
    More info can be seen here:

    m,d,y = date.split('-')
    date_formatted = '-'.join(['20' + y, m, d])
    return date_formatted
